# ENG6Project2
Project Deadlines:
Deadline #1: March 2nd
, 9:10 PM One member of each team must sign up during the sign up session.
Have a team name, the list of team members including student ID numbers, and a ranked list of projects.
Projects will be allocated to teams on a first-come, first-served basis. Use Piazza to find other students to
help complete your team. If you cannot find a team, you will be assigned to one.

Deadline #2: March 5
th, 11:55 pm: Provide a breakdown of programming tasks, and who will be
responsible for what, along with a timeline that will meet the submission deadline. The more specific you
can be in defining the programming tasks, what functions should exist, and what each function should
accomplish, the better. How the submission will be done will be announced.

Deadline #3: March 18th, 11:55 pm: Submission of all materials required by project. How the
submission will be done will be announced.


Grading Criteria:
The projects are open ended. As long as your program can perform the assigned tasks, there will be no
correct or incorrect approaches. Certainly there will be more acceptable and attractive solutions, and that
will be judged in comparison with competing solutions submitted by your classmates. Projects will be
judged against the other projects in the same group that have been submitted. The grading will also take
into account that Project 3 is more formulated while Project 1 & 2 are more open ended.
The expectation is that each team member must take responsibility for a specific aspect of the project and
grading for each member will be adjusted according to how the project tasks were delegated and who was
responsible for what aspects of the project. Each project will allocate at least 10% of the grade to a section
that must be included as Appendix A. Appendix A must contain:

  A table with the breakdown of the tasks to complete the project, and who was responsible for what
    part of the project. The intent here is to determine who did what to implement the project. While it
    is perfectly reasonable that some tasks can be completed jointly, it is unrealistic to claim that
    everyone worked together on all aspects of the project equally.
    
  Each member must provide a brief personal summary of that person’s involvement and
    contributions. Before the project is submitted, the summaries must be provided to all members for 
    review and comment. The end of Appendix A must include the following language: “All team
    members have read the task summaries contained in this report and have been given an
    opportunity to comment. “
    
Project Report Requirements:
Each project submission must have a project report that contains any relevant material deemed essential,
and it must contain an Appendix A as described previously. The first page of the report must contain the
team name and the names of all members. This file must be saved as a PDF document.
The report must provide clear explanations on how your program works, and how problems encountered in
the project are solved. Use flowcharts or diagrams to help illustrate the program’s functionality.
The length of your report is what your team feels is required to fully document and explain your team’s
work. It is good to keep the report to within a reasonable length, while being concise.
In the event that you have used external resources, you must provide appropriate credit in the project report
or in your program code. If it is discovered that you have borrowed or used material from a source that is
not credited, it will be considered plagiarism and the case will be turned over to Student Judicial Affairs.
Youtube Video Requirements:

The format of the video is entirely up to your team as long as the following criteria are met:
  Maximum length of the video is 10 minutes
  Each team member must be seen in the video to present their work and contributions
  A clear and easy to follow demonstration that shows the correct functionality of your program
  (show you program actually working in the video – not screen shots of before and after.)
Use visual aides to help explain your steps (whiteboard, markers, poster, etc.). The video does
not have to be fancy, just effective in relaying the most important information.
